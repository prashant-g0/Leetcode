# 🧠 DSA Journey – My Coding Practice Repository

Welcome to my DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) practice repository! This repo is a collection of my solutions to problems solved across various competitive programming platforms like **LeetCode**, **GeeksforGeeks (GFG)**, **HackerRank**, **Codeforces**, and more.

It’s a work-in-progress journey toward mastering problem-solving and preparing for coding interviews. I continuously update this with new problems, optimized solutions, and learning notes.
