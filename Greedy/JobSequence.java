// Problem Statement:
// Given an array of jobs where every job has a deadline and profit if the job is finished before the deadline.
// It is also given that every job takes a single unit of time so the minimum possible deadline for any job is 1.
// Maximize the total profit if only job can be scheduled at a time.

// Example:
// Input: JobA = (4, 20), JobB = (1, 10), JobC = (1, 40), JobD = (1, 30)
// Output: ans = JobC, JobA
