// We are given a bar of chocolate composed of MxN square pieces.
// One should break the chocolate into single squares.
// Each break of a part of the chocolate is charged a cost expressed by a positive integer. This cost does not depend on the size of the part that is being broken but inly on the line the break goes on.
// Let us denote the costs of breaking along consecutive vertical lines with x1, x2, ..., xM-1 and along horizontal lines with y1, y2, ..., yN-1.
// Compute the minimal cost of breaking the whole chocolate into single squares.
